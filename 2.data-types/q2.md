## I.

#### Answer:

0 is always printed

#### Explanation:

An integer can't hold a letter, so extraction completely fails. `x` is assigned the value 0.

## II.

#### Answer:

The fractional part is dropped (not rounded).

#### Explanation:

Given the number `3.2`, the `3` gets extracted, but `.` is an invalid character, so extraction stops here. The `.2` remains for a future extraction attempt.

## III.

#### Answer:

The entered number is output.

#### Explanation:

A minus sign at the beginning of a number is acceptable, so it is extracted. The remaining numbers are extracted as well.

## IV.

#### Answer:

0 is always printed.

#### Explanation:

An integer can't hold a letter, so extraction completely fails. `x` is assigned the value 0.

## V.

#### Answer:

You are most likely to get the number `2147483647`.

#### Explanation:

`x` can only hold numbers up to a certain size. If you enter a value larger than the largest number x can hold, it will be set to the largest number that `x` can hold (which is probably `2147483647`, but might be different on your system).

## VI.

#### Answer:

The numeric values are printed (e.g. 123).

#### Explanation:

`123` is extracted, the remaining characters (e.g. `abc`) are left for a later extraction.

## VII.

#### Answer:

0 is always printed.

#### Explanation:

An integer can't hold a letter, so extraction completely fails. `x` is assigned the value 0.

## VIII.

#### Answer:

5 is printed.

#### Explanation:

The leading whitespace is skipped. Plus is a valid symbol at the start of a number (just as a minus sign would be), so it is extracted. The 5 is also extracted.

## IX.

#### Answer:

5 is printed.

#### Explanation:

`5` is extracted. `b` is invalid, so extraction stops here. The `b6` remains for a future extraction attempt.
