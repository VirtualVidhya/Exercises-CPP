## I.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
    bool b1 = 8;
    bool b2 = 0;

    std::cout << b1 << '\n';
    std::cout << b2 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
0
```

## II.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
    bool b1 = true;
    bool b2 = false;

    std::cout << b1 << '\n';
    std::cout << b2 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
0
```

## III.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
    char c1 = 'a';
    char c2 = 97;
    char c3 = '9';

    std::cout << c1 << '\n';
    std::cout << c2 << '\n';
    std::cout << c3 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
a
a
9
```

## IV.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
    char c1 = 'ab';
    char c2 = '97';

    std::cout << c1 << '\n';
    std::cout << c2 << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
b
7
```

**Explanation:**

Understanding Character Literals in C++
Single Quotes (' ') Represent Character Literals

In C++, a character literal enclosed in single quotes ('x') must contain only a single character.
If more than one character is placed inside single quotes, it is treated as a multi-character constant, which is implementation-dependent behavior.
What Happens to 'ab' and '97'?

'ab' and '97' contain two characters each, but they are assigned to char variables (c1 and c2), which can only hold one byte (8 bits).
In C++, multi-character constants are treated as integer constants, and their values are determined by the underlying integer representation.
What Happens When You Assign 'ab' and '97' to char?
Since char c1 = 'ab'; and char c2 = '97'; are both multi-character constants, they are converted into integer values, but only the least significant byte is stored in char due to truncation.

Multi-character constants are typically interpreted as a big-endian integer:

'ab' might be interpreted as 0x6162 (if ASCII encoding is used, where 'a' = 0x61 and 'b' = 0x62).
'97' might be interpreted as 0x3937 (where '9' = 0x39 and '7' = 0x37).
However, since char can hold only one byte, it retains the least significant byte:

- c1 = 'ab' → Stores 0x62 ('b')
- c2 = '97' → Stores 0x37 ('7')
